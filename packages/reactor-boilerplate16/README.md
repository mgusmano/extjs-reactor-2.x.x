# ExtReact Boilerplate

A foundation for React apps built with [ExtReact](http://docs.sencha.com/extreact/latest/index.html) components.

## Quick Start

ExtReact and all related packages are hosted on Sencha's private NPM registry. To gain access to this registry, [sign up for a trial of ExtReact](https://www.sencha.com/products/extreact/evaluate).

Once you have received your credentials, you can authenticate by running the following command:

```
npm login --registry=http://npm.sencha.com --scope=@extjs
```

Then, run the following to clone and build the project:

    git clone https://github.com/sencha/extjs-reactor.git
    cd extjs-reactor/packages/reactor-boilerplate
    npm install
    npm start

This will start the app and open it in a browser window.  By default it tries to find
an open port starting with 8080.  You can override the default port by providing `--env.port=(port)` 
as a command line argument.

For example to use port 8081:

    npm start -- --env.port=8081

You can also run and serve a production build using:

    npm run build
    npm run prod

# Tests

This application uses jest to run unit tests.  You can run them with:

```
npm test
```

When you make changes, update test snapshots by running:

```
npm run update-snapshots
```
