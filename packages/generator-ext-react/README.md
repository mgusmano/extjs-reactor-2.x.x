# generator-ext-react 
A Yeoman generator for ExtReact apps.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and `@extjs/generator-ext-react` using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo @extjs/generator-ext-react
```

## Creating a new ExtReact App

If you haven't already, log into Sencha's private registry using the credentials you received in your ExtReact trial or subscription activation email.  If you don't have credentials, you can get them by [signing up for a trial of ExtReact](https://www.sencha.com/products/extreact/evaluate/).

```
npm login --registry=http://npm.sencha.com --scope=@extjs
```

Then, to create a new ExtReact app, run:

```bash
yo @extjs/ext-react
```

The app that is generated is based on the [ExtReact Boilerplate](https://github.com/sencha/extjs-reactor/tree/master/packages/reactor-boilerplate).

## Development

To make changes to the generator, run:

```
git clone git@github.com:sencha/extjs-reactor.git
cd extjs-reactor
npm install
cd packages/generator-ext-react
npm link
```

Now `yo @extjs/ext-react` will use your local copy of the generator.
